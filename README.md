# Fraudulent_Transactions

**Introduction**\
Fraudulent banking transactions are quite a common occurrence today. However, it is not feasible to investigate every transaction for fraud, translating to a poor customer service experience. Machine Learning in finance can automatically build super-accurate predictive maintenance models to identify and prioritize all kinds of possible fraudulent activities. Businesses can then create a data-based queue and investigate the high priority incidents. It allows you to deploy resources in an area where you will see the greatest return on your investigative investment. Further, it also helps you optimize customer satisfaction by protecting their accounts and not challenging valid transactions. Such fraud detection using machine learning can help banks and financial organizations save money on disputes/chargebacks as one can train Machine Learning models to flag transactions that appear fraudulent based on specific characteristics.\
